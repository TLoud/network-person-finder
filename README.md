# network-person-finder
Program, which helps to find different social network profiles of one person and extract public geolocation information 
This project was done for an information security conference in a university. It was done in a collaboration with a good friend in Moscow, Russia in 2014.
The main goal of this program was to show the audience, how easy you can find real-world traces of social-active people. 
We build this program in a hurry with little experience, now I'm planning to improve the low-quality code and add some new features.
Main goal - practicing and improving my skill in programming
